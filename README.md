# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts stock price trends using *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)* deep learning models.  
The app is built with *Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and Streamlit*, allowing users to search for any stock ticker and visualize historical data along with predicted future trends.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fetches *historical stock data* (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) from Yahoo Finance.
- Splits data into *training and testing sets*.
- Uses *MinMaxScaler* for normalization.
- Trains an *LSTM model* for time-series forecasting.
- Interactive *Streamlit dashboard* for stock analysis.
- Supports both *Indian (e.g., SBIN.NS, TCS.NS)* and *US stocks (e.g., IBM, AMZN, AAPL)*.
